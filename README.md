Abstract
--------
> SharePoint 2013 gives developers two options for accessing their data remotely using either the client side object model (CSOM) or OData… also known as REST. Both provide different methods for getting data and have their own advantages as well as disadvantages. For those of us who prefer the REST option, we know there are a few challenges in that we have a lot of plumbing we need to write. In this session you’ll learn how the free and open source library Breeze turns working with the SharePoint REST API a breeze! Breeze brings validation, entity checks, batching, change tracking, and client-side caching to the client... think an ORM like Entity Framework in JavaScript! In this session you’ll learn how to set it up, how to configure it, how to write different types of queries and then how to even use some really slick data validation capabilities in the browser!
