BreezeJS Makes Client-Side SharePoint 2013 REST Development a... BREEZE!
========================================================================

Abstract
--------
> SharePoint, both in on-premises & SharePoint Online in Office 365, offer a REST API for developers to create server side and client side solutions. In this session we'll dive deep into the world of REST and see what's involved in creating client-side, JavaScript based solutions as well as server-side managed code solutions. After exploring all the nuts and bolts to become a REST ninja, we will then look at the free and open source library BreezeJS that simplifies a lot of the plumbing work for you. In this session you'll learn how to set it up, how to configure it, how to write different types of queries and then how to even use some really slick data validation capabilities in the browser!
